# üîê Login Server & Authentication

*Secure gateway to the world of L2R*

---

## ‚òÖ **Basic Network Foundation**
- **Bevy Plugin Architecture** - Clean modular design with `bevy_slinet` TCP integration
- **Packet Processing** - Basic client packet handlers (AuthLogin, ServerList, GameServerLogin, AuthGG)
- **Configuration System** - TOML-based config with database/Redis connection settings
- **Metrics Integration** - Basic server OpenMetrics collection

## ‚ö° **Cryptographic Protocol**
- **RSA Implementation** - 1024-bit RSA key exchange for session establishment (working)
- **Blowfish Foundation** - Basic encryption setup, but full packet encryption needs work
- **Session Keys** - Session key generation implemented, but lifecycle management incomplete
- **Protocol Versions** - Multiple L2 protocol version detection framework in place

## ‚ö° **Authentication Framework**
- **Account Repository** - Generic database repository pattern implemented but minimal features
- **Password Storage** - Basic bcrypt integration for auto-created accounts (limited)
- **Login Flow** - Core authentication packet handling exists but validation is basic
- **Database Integration** - PostgreSQL connection established, but user management is minimal

## üî® **Server Management (Stubbed)**
- **Game Server List** - Hard-coded server list with fake player counts (`rng.gen_range(1..3000)`)
- **Server Status** - Always returns `Status::Good` regardless of actual server state (TODO)
- **Connection Management** - Framework exists but lacks proper session validation and cleanup

## üî® **Security Features (Missing)**
- **Session Validation** - Basic session creation but no proper timeout/cleanup mechanisms
- **Rate Limiting** - No DDoS protection or connection throttling implemented
- **Ban System** - Database schema might exist but no enforcement logic
- **Anti-Replay** - Packet sequence validation not implemented/anti-packet-spam
- **Logging & Monitoring** - Only Basic logging exists but no needed admin/security event tracking

## üî® **Advanced Features (Dreams)**
- **Two-Factor Authentication** - Not implemented, would require significant infrastructure
- **Account Recovery** - No email system or recovery mechanisms
- **GameGuard Integration** - Anti-cheat system integration completely missing
