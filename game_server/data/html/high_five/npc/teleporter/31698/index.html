the Rune Township is very different from other villages of Elmore. For one thing, it is quite a bit larger than other
villages. In fact, it's so huge that the structure of the village itself is divided into upper and lower levels!
Therefore, people within the village have access to other parts of the village through the gate of time and space.<br>
Now, would you like to visit the town's library?<br>
